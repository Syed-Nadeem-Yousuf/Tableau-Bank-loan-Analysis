# Tableau-Bank-loan-Analysis

🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: Loan Data Analysis Dashboard Using Tableau!

🎯 Objectives:

As part of my ongoing Data Analyst internship at AI Variant, I worked on a project to enhance my data analysis skills using financial datasets. The goal was to analyze trends in loan data, understand repayment behaviors, and assess risk factors. This experience allowed me to practice using Tableau for visualizing key metrics and making data-driven recommendations.

📁 Data Handling:

For this project, I worked with anonymized and aggregated financial data to ensure data confidentiality while still gaining valuable insights. The datasets used were thoroughly prepared and contained no sensitive or personally identifiable information.

⚒ Key Areas of Focus:

. Year-wise trends in loan amounts issued
. Analysis of loan balances across different grades and sub-grades
. Comparison of payments between verified and non-verified borrowers
. Loan repayment trends by state and month
. Patterns in homeownership and loan repayment behavior

🔑 Skills Demonstrated:

Throughout this project, I applied various data analysis techniques, such as:

. Creating interactive visualizations in Tableau
. Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) for financial analysis
. Uncovering trends and patterns to inform strategic decisions

Conclusion

The insights I gained from this project helped me develop a deeper understanding of loan portfolio management and risk assessment. This experience has been crucial in enhancing my Tableau skills and preparing me for real-world data analysis challenges.
